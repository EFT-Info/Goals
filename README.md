# Goals

## Long Term

A repository of generic map data (for example: EFT-Info/MapData with a folder for each map) that describes the layout of each level (the shapes that make up the world, roads, walls, buildings) and the items spawn locations, extracts, locked doors (possibly in another file, Xyz_Map.xml and Xyz_Map_Details.xml). The data should be easily parsed (and all the numbers crunched) by programs. This data should not describe the potential drawing (or how to use it).

Another repository dedicated to turning the first one into useful maps (potentially with different purposes, like one for just extracts, one for key spawns, one for high tier loot, looting routes, etc.) The dream is these maps could be interactive.

A site to display the information.

## Short Term

Simple map wire frame data.

Simple transformation into image output.

Simple site with links to the images.

## Very Short Term

Map out factory or a made up level and get it drawing into an image.

## Other Stuff

It would be great if this account could be a portal to all sorts of information, so I'd likely accept any offers to contribute.
